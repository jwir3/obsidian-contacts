# Obsidian Contacts NextGen Plugin
Originally based off of [Obsidian Contacts Plugin](https://github.com/vbeskrovnov/obsidian-contacts) by [Vadim Beskrovnov](https://github.com/vbeskrovnov), this plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) allows you to easily organize and manage your contacts. Simply create a note with contact information and use the plugin's features to quickly search and sort through your contacts. The Contacts NextGen plugin also helps you to remember birthdays of your contacts, and keeps track of the last time you met with them!

```
Feel free to add more rows, and leave existing ones empty. **Do not rename or delete** existing keys, as they are used internally by the plugin.

### Searching for Ð¡ontacts
You can use different sorting options to find the required contacts:
- Use sorting by birthday to find contacts with the nearest birthdays.
- Use sorting by last contact date to find contacts that you haven't talked to in a long time.
- Use sorting by name to find a specific contact.

## Contact Template Format

The format for the template file is YAML and is considered [Frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) for a given page. By defining the necessary items in the frontmatter form, information about the contact is communicated through the plugin to the application. When in reading mode, the frontmatter will be formatted using an HTML table.  This format is also supported by the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, allowing you to build queries for your contacts.

> :warning: **Do not change or remove `type` field**. It is used to detect if the current file is a contact.

> :warning: **It needs to be placed at the very top of the file**. Be very careful here!
